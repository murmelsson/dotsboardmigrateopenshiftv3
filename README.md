This is a Java EE7 webapp game for 1 or 2 players (initial release as 2-player game, 1-player version in the pipeline).

The game itself has been around as a paper-based strategy game for years - back in the days, murmelssonic played it at high-school... and now there are several computer implementations of it... though murmelssonic has never seen any of that implementation code... so anyway this is a hobby-implementation in Java EE, and uses WebSockets.

[add more details later..]

This implementation written by murmelssonic, first working version in 2014. Published on rhcloud.com in April 2015.

To-do: css clean-up; 1-player game; etc

[add any licensing stuff later, but basically this code would be available to anyone who wants, and the basic structure relies heavily on the TicTacToe implementation code by Nicholas Williams in "Professional Java for Web Applications" (Wrox, 2014).]
